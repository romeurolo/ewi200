Inverter welder reverse engineering using Ghidra.
The purpose it´s to provide a decent start up in sticking weelding, since the machine it´s well build and after start up it´s powerfull and reliable.
GOALS - Change the OCV routine (probably create interrupt to handle) to respond quickly, and add hotstart

Recourses used: stlinkv2 (clone), Ghidra (NSA), svdLoader (Py script), cheap logic analyzer and welder Control Board

CPU - stm8l15c6
